# Urban-Tree-Density-Detection-Using-NDVI-Satellite-Imagery
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing tree density in urban areas using satellite imagery and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). By identifying tree-covered regions, the project helps assess whether an area has sufficient greenery or needs more tree plantation for better environmental balance.
